          <p>
            Hey, I'm Harsha ‚Äî a passionate visual storyteller with a love for raw, real moments. Photography isn't just something I do... it's how I see the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey started behind a phone lens, capturing light and emotion in everyday life. What began as a hobby quickly turned into a deeper pursuit ‚Äî to freeze time and feeling through my frame.

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I started taking pictures just for fun, often with no fancy gear or planned shoots. Over time, I learned how powerful an image can be ‚Äî how it tells stories words can't. I fell in love with that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I shoot portraits, street scenes, and nature ‚Äî always chasing realness and mood. Whether I'm walking through city streets or exploring hidden corners, my goal is simple: to make people feel something through my photos.

        <h2>My Gear</h2>
        <p>
          I believe gear doesn't make the photographer, but it helps elevate the vision. Here's what I use:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Camera(s):</strong> Nikon D60, D3000</li>
          <li><strong>Lenses:</strong> 18-55 mm, 55-200 mm</li>
          <li><strong>Editing:</strong> Lightroom, Snapseed</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="about-subsection">
        <h2>Mobile Photography</h2>
        <p>
          A lot of my favorite shots were taken with my phone ‚Äî because sometimes the moment doesn't wait for you to grab your DSLR. I love the challenge and spontaneity of mobile photography.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use a Google Pixel with manual control apps and do most editing right on the phone. It's proof that creativity > gear.
